# FRAME17

- 需要把整個資料夾設為路徑才能 work
- mac 檔案為 LF，windows 檔案為 CRLF，經測試 windows 系統可能會發生不會換行造成檔案看起來混亂。
- matlab.m 檔編碼為 utf8，如果為預設中文系統語系的 big5 編碼，中文可能會出現亂碼並會造成無法預期的錯誤。

  Program Assignment No. 1 (weight=1)

  Note that each program assignment has its own weight.
  Usually, the larger the weight, the more time you are expected
  to spend on the assignment.

      Assigned: (10/19/2017)
      Due: (11/2/2017)

    (1) Complete function INPUT
    (2) Complete the main program FRAME17 up to
        % ^^* UP TO HERE  --- PROG 1 ^^*
    (3) Test problem: see programming 1.pdf; you shall
      create an input file and run the program to write out
        the data (in subroutine INPUT) to see if the output
        data are the same as the input data. In addition, use function
        DrawingStructure to check the geometry of the structures.
    (4) Sumbit the following to CEIBA in archive file (*.zip or *.rar):
        (a) Program source code "FRAME17.m"
        (b) Input file "*.ipt"

  Program Assignment No. 2 (weight=2)
          (11/2/2017)
      Due: 11/16/2017

    (1) Complete functions IDMAT, MEMDOF, and SEMIBAND.
    (2) *Complete main program FRAME17 up to
        % ^^* UP TO HERE  --- PROG 2 ^^*
    (3) Test your program :
        It is required that you test the above functions
        using the two examples described in programming2.pdf
        You should check IDND, NEQ, LM, and NSBAND.
        Compare the results with those obtained by hand calculations.
        (You should upload the results to the Ceiba. )
